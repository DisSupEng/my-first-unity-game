# my-first-unity-game
This is my first attempt at creating a 3D game in Unity by following a tutorial on youtube. Tutorial can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j48LtUkZRjU&amp;list=PLPV2KyIb3jR5QFsefuO2RlAgWEz6EvVi6.


Goal of the game:
The goal of this game is to control a box through a series of obstacles. 

Structure of this repo:
Note that I have already started this game before creating this repo so
not all tutorials will be present.

On completion of the tutorials I may even continue to expand this game on my own. Some ideas for how I would expand this game are written below.

- Make the game more of a racing game with other AI cars
- Create custom player vehicles in blender
- Add a main menu with different levels and options

I want to keep expanding this project because it is important that I show I'm capable of self learning and expanding my own knowledge base.
